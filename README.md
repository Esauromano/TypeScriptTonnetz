# TypeScriptTonnetz

TypeScriptTonnetz is a set of functions and operations from Mathematical Music Theory (transformational approach) in Typescript. Specifically, it deals with Tonnetz spaces and functions related to the topic.

It emerged as a development branch to contribute to Miika Alonen's phenomenal [ZifferJS](https://github.com/amiika/zifferjs) project.



## Features implemented

Transformations and functions follow the edge flip between triangles and geometries (so far), so they maintain two common notes (not necessarily voice-leading considerations). In other words, diferent Tonnetz Spaces follow the voice-leading spaces geometry of the conventional Tonnetz.
